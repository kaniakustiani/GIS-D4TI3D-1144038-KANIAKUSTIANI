PACIAL DATA, vector and RASTER



Most of the sepacial Data will be ditanagani in the SIG is spacial dataa, berorintasi data geographically. This data has a certain coordinate system as the reference base and has a two-part pentinf that is different from other data i.e. information site (spacial) information and descriptions that are described as follows:


Infromasi site (spatial), deals with a good geographical coordinates coordinates (latitude and longitude) and XYZ coordinates, including datum and projection information.
Descriptive information (attributes) or information nonspasial, a site that has some information related to it. An example of this type of vegetation, population, area, zip code etc.


Spacial Data data is the data that berferensi top reperensi geographical objects on the Earth, berdsarakan map containing insterestasi and proyeks the whole phenomenon that is on the Earth. Natural or man-made phenomena have two types:

1. Vector


Is a vector that can display and store data puts spacial using dots line or curve or polygon and attributes-attributes. Basic forms of data representation is defined by two dimensional coordinate system in the model daa vector line or curve is the set of ordered points in the polygon is formed memlaui connect full if the start and end points have the same coordinates value with a starting point.


2. Raster

Raster object is dipermukan bum sodajikan as elements of the matrix grid cells and tang triomogen the editor raster models, menampatkan and spacial data store by using a srtuktur matrix and pixels-pixels that make up the grid.



Conclusion: a vector that can display and store data puts spacial using dots line or curve or polygon and attributes-attributes. Raster object is dipermukan bum sodajikan as elements of the matrix grid cells and tang triomogen the editor raster models


Suggestions: anything that will have to be tempered with the sincere and patient.
