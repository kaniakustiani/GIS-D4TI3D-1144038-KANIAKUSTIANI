GIS (Geografphic information system)
===================================
With the current development of Geographic Information Systems is very important, nearly every corner of the world of men familiar with the terms of today's technology, called GIS (Geografphic information system), Geography comes from the combination of the word 'geo' and 'graphy. Geo means earth while Graphy means the process of writing, it can be said Geography meant the writing process on earth.
In a broad sense is the application of GIS spatial data processing with the use of a computerized system of graphic data with attribute data objects such as digital base map (basic map) bergeoferensi earth. In general, GIS is a component consisting of software, hardware, geographic data and human resources that work together effectively to input, store, repair, manage, memeperluas, analyze and present data in information-based GIS Geographic .. In tedapat coordinates term.

Coordinate
==========
Coordinates are a result of the point of intersection between the latitude and longitude that shows an object.
At the point of coordinates is divided into two, Latitude and Longitude.
1. Latitude is a leading latitude from the equator (0) to the South Pole or the equator kekutub north 0-90 degrees and 0-90 degrees.
2. adaalah Longitude and latitude numbers rounded corners of the earth horizontally, the starting point of 0 to 180 and 0 to -180 opposite direction. 0 starting point from England precisely located in the city of Greenwich and agreed by many scientists astrologers as the center of zero degrees as early pehitungan time called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in 1884.
Latitude and Longitude adalaah function to measure the distance between one point to another point it. Coordinate point becomes important when the map had been reading. The coordinates of the navigation system is applied in shipping and aviation, wherever they may be. The coordinates in the map is also used when performing evacuation of taking casualties, in the middle of the forest and sea search.
