Latar Belakang 

Physical Layer is the lowest layer of the OSI layer model of the computer network. This layer relates to an electrical problem, procedural, activate, maintain and deactivate the physical relationship. This layer also relate to the characters, voltage, time changes in voltage, maximum transmission distances, physical connectors, and other matters relating to the physical. Devices that operate at this layer are hubs, repeaters, network adapter / network interface cards and host bus adapters (used in storage area network).
	The function of Phisical Layer is related to electrical (and optical) connections between devices. The binary data is encoded in a form that can be transmitted through the network media, for example cables, transceivers and connectors associated with the Physical layer. Equipment such as repeaters, hubs and network cards are located in this layer.
	Physical data modeling is a model that uses a number of tables to illustrate the data as well as the relationship between these data. Each table has a column in which each column has a unique name.
A physical model data (aka database design) is a representation of the design data and constraints into account facilities given database management system. In the project life cycle is usually derived from a logical data model, although it may be reverse-engineered from the implementation of a given database. A complete physical model of the data will include all database artifacts needed to create relationships between tables or achieve performance goals, such as indexes, constraints definition, linking table, the partitioned table or cluster. Physical Data models can usually be used to calculate estimates of storage and storage allocation may include details specific to a particular database system.
	Currently, there are six main database in the business market, Oracle, Postgres, SQL Server, Sybase, DB2 and MySQL. There are many other major RDBMS systems out there, but these tend either to be a legacy database or used in such academic university or college of further education. A physical model data at each implementation will be significantly different, not least because the needs of the underlying OS that sits below them. For example, SQL Server that only runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems, while Oracle and MySQL can run on Solaris, Linux and UNIX-based operating systems and Windows.
