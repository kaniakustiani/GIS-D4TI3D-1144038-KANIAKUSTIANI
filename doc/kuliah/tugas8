BACKGROUND
A Proxy is a proxy folder open source for geospatial data. This cache to accelerate and change data from existing map services and cater to every desktop or web GIS client.
Server folder is to transform the vector file shp geospatial web services into the picture.

DISCUSSION
A MapServer CGI programs (Common Gateway Interface). The program will be executed on the web server, and is based on a few certain parameters (especially the configuration in the file *. FOLDER) will result in a data which will then be sent to a web browser, either in the form of an image map or other forms.

How the installation folder of the Server
1. To run a server folder, first run centos on virtual box
2. next connect the network with virtualbox host computer
3. After that, belonging to root through the terminal
4. Then type in terminal mapserver5 #install
5. Wait until the installation process is complete
After performing the steps above, then install the Proxy Folder as follows:
1. open the terminal type #install python-pip
2. Then type #python-dev
3. Then type #pip install mapproxy
4. Then type #install Vwsqi
5. After that wait until the install process is complete
The following is a script the way the menginstallasi Folder through the Exchange Server Linux is as follows:

services:
  demo:
  tms:
    use_grid_names: true
    # origin for /tiles service
    origin: 'nw'
  kml:
      use_grid_names: true
  wmts:
    # use restful access to WMTS
    restful: true
    # this is the default template for MapProxy
    restful_template: '/{Layer}/{TileMatrixSet}/{TileMatrix}/{TileCol}/{TileRow}.{Format}'
    # and also allow KVP requests
    kvp: true
    md:
      # metadata used in capabilities documents for WMTS
      # if the md option is not set, the metadata of the WMS will be used

Conclusion:
MapServer is an open source and freeware application that allows us to display spatial data (maps) on the web. At the meeting this time we will discuss on how to Installation Folder from the Server.
Suggestions:
Use the applications Folder of the Server because we can use and apply easily in our own computers.
